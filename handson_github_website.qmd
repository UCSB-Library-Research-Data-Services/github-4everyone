title: "Using the GitHub website"
---

In this section, we will be using the GitHub.com website and demonstrate that you do not need to be a programmer to use version control and edit files on GitHub.

::: {.callout-note collapse=true}
### Don't have a GitHub account?

If you have not already created a GitHub username, please do so now:

- GitHub: <https://github.com>
- Follow optional [advice on choosing your username](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)

## Collaborator Workflow

::: {.callout-tip}

### Our asks

### As a Team of two

- Help each other, everyone is bringing different skills! Talk it out!
- Listen to each other; avoid judgment and solutioneering.
- Have fun!


### Prompt

We want to log the information about people's favorite desserts using a repository.

:::


#### Person 1 (owner):

- Create a repository using the following  [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo) steps 1-6

![](img/github-dessert-repo.png)

- Edit the README to:
   - Replace the title (first line starting with `#`) with something better! Maybe `Favorite Desserts`
   - Add your name and your favorite dessert below the title: e.g.  ` - Julien: crepes`

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/github-readme_desserts.png")
```

- Add Person 2 as a collaborator following these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)


#### Person 2 (collaborator): 

- Check your email to accept the invitation
- Go to the repository website (link is provided in the invitation)
- Start editing the `README.md` by clicking on the pen at the top of the README.md file to edit it

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/github-readme-edit.png")
```

- Add your name and your favorite dessert below the title: e.g.  ` - Sophia: chocolate`
- Click _Commit changes_
- Add a descriptive commit message, "add my favorite dessert"


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/github-commit.png")
```

- Click _Commit changes_ to confirm

```{r commit-button, out.width="20%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/github-commit-button.png")
```


#### Person 1: add a csv file

Download this [csv file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brunj7/eds214-handson-ghcollab/main/data/iconic_desserts.csv) about the most iconic desserts in America (according to this website <https://www.eatthis.com/iconic-desserts-united-states/>) to your computer. Note: depending on your web browser settings you might have to right-click on the page and select _Save As_.

- Drag and drop it on the Github web page of your repository to upload it
- Add a short message about the file e.g. `Add iconic_desserts.csv` & hit `Commit changes`
- Your have has been uploaded. Click on the filename to see it!

You should have something similar to this repo: <https://github.com/brunj7/favorite-desserts>


#### Person 2: add an R script

This is the script we used to scrape the iconic desserts listing: 

```{r getting the data, eval=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)  # use to scrape website content

# Check if that data folder exists and create it if not
dir.create("data", showWarnings = FALSE)

# Read the webpage code
webpage <- read_html("https://www.eatthis.com/iconic-desserts-united-states/")

# Extract the desserts listing
dessert_elements<- html_elements(webpage, "h2")
dessert_listing <- dessert_elements %>% 
  html_text2() %>%             # extracting the text associated with this type of element of the webpage
  as_tibble() %>%              # make it a data frame
  rename(dessert = value) %>%  # better name for the column
  head(.,-3) %>%               # 3 last ones were not desserts 
  rowid_to_column("rank") %>%  # adding a column using the row number as proxy for the rank
  write_csv("data/iconic_desserts.csv") # save it as csv
```


How would you add this code as an R Script to your repository?


### Bonus 

Person 2: Try to edit the csv file directly on GitHub! 

Person 1: Your turn!

***No need to be a programmer to contribute to analytical workflows with GitHub!!***

### Fork Workflow

If you want to contribute to a repository that you have not been added to as a collaborator, you need to first fork the repository. This creates a linked copy under your username that you can edit. Once you are done with your contribution, you can send a request to incorporate your changes to the original repository using what is called a Pull Request, in other words, you ask the repository owner to pull your changes into their repository.


::: {.callout-tip}

### Our ask




### Prompt

With **another** collaborator keep logging information about people's favorite desserts using the fork workflow.

:::

#### Person 2: Create a Fork of the person 1 repository

- Get the link the repository from Person 1 via the Zoom chat
- Go to their repository webpage
- Create a Fork by clicking on the Fork button on the top right view of your repository homepage

```{r fork-button, out.width="60%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/github-fork-button.png")
```

- On your Fork, start editing the `README.md` 
- Add the name of a friend and their favorite dessert below your previous entries: e.g.  ` - Eliott: donut`
- Add a descriptive commit message

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/github-commit.png")
```

- Commit your changes

```{r commit-button2, out.width="20%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/github-commit-button.png")
```
- Create a Pull Request (PR) to merge those changes to the main repository using these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)


#### Person 1:

- Go to *your* repository and merge the PR
