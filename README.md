# UC Love Data Week (LDW) 2024 -- GitHub for everyone

In this workshop, we will explore the features of the GitHub website to manage and version content as a team. We will go over how to create a repository, edit files, and leverage the markdown syntax for documenting and tracking your work. We will also demonstrate how to invite collaborators. Participating in this workshop requires no coding skills or pre-installs (including the hands-on session). Everything will be done from your web browser!
